Do_androids_dream_of_electric_sheep

Q:What (if any) is the difference between a "real" thing and a replica or simulation of something?


my version:



others version:

No, they dream of real sheep.

conclu:
cuz they either dream of real sheep, or they are not sufficiently emotional or embedded in the social system of all the human kibble to desire one.


analyse:

Whether they "dream" in the literal sense is unclear. We are asked 
explicitly, however, to imagine that they do, such that an android might not even know it was not human. If they did dream of sheep, they would be electric because they are imagined in their mind, but would be real in that they would be imaginings of a real sheep.

If taken to mean "desire", the spotlight is on the android's motivations. Is there any sense in which the android is any different to humans in the book (who desire real animals as status symbols)? They both have ambitions and desires that are no weaker than those of humans. So one might expect again the answer "no, they would aspire to real sheep", just as the rest of society.

But the social prestige attached to real animals is more of an illusion than a false animal itself. The human characters in the book hate the destroyed world and much of there are clear examples of escapism and, crucially, artificial emotion and religion, supposedly the things that makes the realness of owning a sheep critical.
