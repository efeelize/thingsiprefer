the whole world is just made of people who didn't kill themselves today.it's all of us:okay,fuck it,keep doing it.life can get
 very difficult,very sad,very upsetting,but u don't have to do it,u really don't have to do it.u never have to do anyth,becuz u 
can  kill urself.u can do that,u can do that once.it's interesting becuz even when life gets bad,people generally choose it over
 nothing,even the worst versions of life,even a shitty,shitty life.is worth living,apparently,cuz folks r living the fuck out of 
them.

u need to make them know it against their will.while they're exploding sexually and beating the shit out of each other.

u should act in the way,that everbody acted that way ths would work out.u should,becuz it would be mayhem if everybody was like
that.most people kinda don't care about it.most people are very selfish.most people don't give a shit what happens as long as
they get to do their favorite th.people don't even want to back off from their favorite th.they won't even do their second 
favorite th.

if our parent group and our class were a platoon of soldiers,she'd be the one that we'd put soap bars in socks and we'd frag that
bitch in her sleep.she would wash right the fuck out.she would't make it.

i don't know how i'm gonna tell my kids,how the fuck do u complete with that,how do u take a miserable person with no control
over their lives and tell them with a straight face:uh.u can't do drugs,all drugs are a perfect solution to every problem u
have right now.how do u beat that?

--she's love of ur life.
--she's not the love of my death.motherfucker.

marriage is a big deal...u're either alone,or u're in a shitty th.that covers 100% of human beings...who do u think u r?it just
didn't get shitty yet.so arrogant,yeah,i think we figured it out.of course it's going to get shitty.that's part of it.and u're
gonna hate the person u love right now.that's the way it works.love plus time minus distance equals hate.love is the best th of
the world,but don't be greedy and expect it to last.don't be amazed that a butterfly died cuz u shot it in the face.just fall in
love,make a fucking mess,it goes shitty,u don't realize it until too late,and then u cry a lot and move on.it's the best part of
life...why the person:for years,for our whole lives...that's insane to expect that.it's a little th u get to catch,and then it
rots and dies.that's just the way it goes.
