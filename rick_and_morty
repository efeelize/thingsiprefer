--don't do it.
--u quit school,but u still got some learning to do.
--oh,u think so,huh?well,let's see.
--hey,wait...huh?i don't get it.
--of course u don't.but he did.he knew that once i got back to may car,one of two ths was gonna happen.
  i was gonna have  to toss a broken battery,or the battery would't be broken.

--it's nice to get back to the basics,after a pretty intense,mixed-bag of a year.
--relax,that's what wind-shields are for.

--it's horrible.
--yeah...u wanna check it out?

--u r the worst.how can u be into this?u know,people r gonna kill each other.
--so what?u trying to sit here and tell me that,if there's a video online with someone getting decapitated,
  u don't clik on it?
--no.why would i do that?u do that?
--i don't .becuz it would bore me.i see like that for breakfast.but if u don't do it,i say it's becuz u're
  afraid of ur own primal instincts,so u stuff them down,and...oh!shh..it's starting.

--that was gross.man,i think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this.my appetite for purge speciating got 
  filled pretty quick.

--how can i refuse after all u've done to blackmail me?
--geez,u working on ur tight five for the comedy store?

--whatcha doing?
--is that a real qustion?
--just making conversation.
--r u?what part of that gives me anything to work with?my choice is to say nothing,be sarcastic,or bark'yes'
  like a trained animal.u're holding me verbally hostage.
--okay,ass-face.

i don't want to be the 'a little help'guy,but a little help?

--no such agenda,cheif.we're not too keen on the purge,either.
--geez.wow...now u're getting into it.never expected that out of u...i had my fill.

--this isn't healthy,u know ,u 're really up to no good around here at this place.u think u're great 
  together,but u're just bringing out the worst in each other.
--oh,gee.well put.why don't we see what unity thinks?
--i'm just taking a little break from stuff.u know,i need to relax.

--he's just hyper emotional,needy little...what's the word i'm looking for here?,,,hunman.it runs in 
  the family.i can tolerate it,but i can't give a crap about it.take a hike.
--i'm not looking for judgment,just a yes or no.
--don't waste ur brain on those weirdo.they're no different from any of the aimless chumps that u 
  occupy.they just put at the center of their lives becuz u're powerful.and becuz they put u there,
  they want u to be less powerful.never gonna happen though,right?back in a flash.best weekend ever.
  let's see how long we can go.


forgive me for doing this in notes.i'm not strong enough to do it in persons.i realize now that i'm
attracted to u for the same reason i can't be with u.u can't change.and i have no problem with that,
but it clearly means i have a problem with myself.i'm sure there's no perfect version of me,i'm sure
i'll unify species after species and never really be complete.but i know how it goes with us.i lose
who i am and become part of u.becuz in a strange way,u're better at what i do without even trying.
urs,and nobody else's.

--what happened with unity?
--who?oh,unity.yeah,well..i mean,honesty,we're talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement,u
  know?it's not cool.,fun is fun.but who needs it?

--there's no tough titty than a psychotic break.
--well,that's depends on who break first..me or the titty.

the day i invented the portal gun is the day i lost her...yeah,that's the three lines of math that 
seperate my life,as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.

--i want u have a normal life,that's sth u can't have when ricks shows up,everyth real turns out fake.
everth rights wrong.all u know is that u know noth and he knows everth...and,well,he's not a villan,
but he should't be ur hero.he's more like a demon,or a super fuck-ed god...u think my ricks dead,he's
alive,u think u r safe,he's coming for u.
--let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard.


--s306 BGM

hey,did u ever want to hold a terrifold?
i got one right here
grab my terri-flap
squeeze it
grab it,squeeze it.
tug on my terri-flap
hey ,i want to take u to
the terrifold dance
wanna come with me.u can grab my holdiefold
squeeze'em tight
u son of bitch
suck my holdie-flappy folds
lick my flappy foldie-holes
my terri-flaps in ur mouth
suck my flaps,u piece of shit


--that stuff is alive and it belongs with us.we yank them from their homes and locked them in a can.
--that's what they do,they live in pain.they are pain.they are all the bad parts of us.which,by the 
  way,incl our dishonsety.
--so now ,becuz i'm make entirely of toxins i'm also a liar?u little sociopath.

--i had all my problems removed--my entilement,my narcissism,my crippling loneliness,my irrational 
  attachments.u poor,dumb,sick animals.

--u weren't a 14-year-old boy from the midwest,who ran away from his family an capitalized on his
  lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker?
--i guess i was pretty up front about that,wasn't i?


--ther're the writers of their own press releases.ther're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour 
  talking and 20 minutes jumping around while shit blows up.

--let me check my list of power and weakness,ability is to do anything...but only whenever i want...yeah,
  that sounds like a job for me.

  i was also late becuz of my drinking and mentioned it to zero applause.

  superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everth like it's mind blowing.

--it's really bums me out.it's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like me.
--they just call themselves heroes so they can ...
--i'm calling them that!they are my heroes,mine!
--huh,no accounting for taste.

--everyone in the universe is a hero,all u have to do is know the difference between good and bad.
--he says the good and bad are artifical constructs.
--i get the feeling...he kind of needs that to be the case.


--jesus christ,what a shitty neutrino bomb.it's a miracle i ever actually destroy anything.
--ooh,i don't know.u managed to destory just about everything today.the villains,the heroes,the lines between them,
  my childhood...
--thank yeewwwww.i appreciate it.i know u were sucking the kool-aid out of the vindicators'dick.so the fact that
  i was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.
--yeah,it is.u know why?becuz when u're an asshole,it doesn't matter how right u r.nobody wants to give u the
  satisfaction.
--i know,everyone wants people they like to be right.that's why popular people are fucking dumb and why u 
  pretentious,poorly-written high budget friends back there can eat a double-decker shit sandwich
--guys,stop! u're just proving my asshole garndpa right!

--oof! didn't see that coming 
--is that sarcasm?i don't want u slipping away when this is over.all of these deaths r on ur hands.
--okay,maybe couple of them,but definitely not this guy.

--open to second opinion.
--hey ,i don't know,i mean,look,when i get drunk,i get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it.it's,like,
  it's possible i got so drunk.i felt i was losing morty to Vindicators.and maybe this is my way of saying.'okay,
  u can have him but only if u know how important he is.otherwise i will kill u.'
--that is a...really specific guess.
--look,there's nothing in the room but us,i'm just using logic to connect some dots,it's the best guess i've got.

--but u r betting our lives on it.
--i'ii cover that bet.i get it.
--well,i think u're doing that smirky face becuz u're misinterpreting the moment.i am not being coy about some 
  hidden love for u.i want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess,like,if i gave u an amulet lase
  night,or...

--sorry,i'm not good at goodbyes,and..i'm drunk so,u know,i just...it looks like i'm never going to see u again.
  i can't really roll with the hero types and i don't...they...they don't want me around.but i want u to know.even
  if i didn't show it at the time,i really appreciated u sticking by me.god damn it.why am i crying?it make no 
  sense.ugh,u're...u're probably confused,becuz we barely knew each other,but u really stuck ur neck out when u
  gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room.everbody else had their head so far up their ass.even my
  own grandson is like,'oh,the Vindicators,they're so cool'.i mean ,he's a moron,that's their demographic.but u're
  different.Noob Noob.u're fucking cool.and u're smart.and i bet we coulda hung out and shit.and i hope u get to be
  a full-fledged Vindicator.do me a favor,don't...don't let them know that i got emotionals.but u can tell them one
  thing.tell them i said...oh fuck.okay,i just shit myself.okay,later.


--never said that.
--yeah.i feel safe already.
--no doubt,who do we make the check out to.
--i will say,we r getting some good licks in while chocking to death...right?

--can't argur with that.
--come on.this can't be the way i go out.this is the mega genius equivalent of dying on the toilet.
--cuz this pickle doesn't care about ur children.and i'm not gonna take their dreams,i'm gonna take their parents.

it's not my job to take sides or pass judgement.

he won't have to ask for it.he won't need it.he'll just make more.he doesn't need anything for anyone.

that will be ur downfall.not being open to new experiences.

well,she knows.i mean,we don't really buy into that kind of crap.to the extent that love is an expression of 
famillarity over time,my access to infinite timelines preclude the necessity of attachment.in fact,i even 
abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.yeesh.

--u r lucky fella.
--i have had a rough day.and i've sustained a lot of damage.i'm pretty close to death.

becuz i don't respect therapy.becuz i'm a scientist.becuz  i invent,transform,create,and destory for a living.
and when i don't like sth about the world,i change it.and i don't think going to a rented office in a strip
mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which word mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do
anything.i think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking,which is a state of mind we 
value in the animals we eat,but not sth i want for myself.i am not a cow.i am a pickle,when i feel like it.
so...u asked.

the only connection between ur unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destory ur family is that everyone 
in ur family,u inclued,use intelligence to justify sickness.u seem to alternate between viewing ur own mind as
an unstoppable force as inescapable curse.and i think it's becuz the only truly unapproachable concept for u
is that it's ur mind within ur control.u chose to come here,u chose to talk to belittle my vocation just as u
choose to become a pickle.u r the master of ur universe,and yet u r dripping with rat blood and feces.ur 
emormous mind literally vegetating by ur own hand.i have no doubt that u would be bored senseless by therapy,
the same way i'm bored when i brush my teeth and wipe my ass.becuz the th about repairing,maintaining,and claning
is not an adventure.there's no way to do it so wrong u might die.it's just work.and bottom line is,some people r
going to work,and some people...well,some people would rather to die.each of us gets to choose.
