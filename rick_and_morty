--there's no tough titty than a psychotic break.
--well,that's depends on who break first..me or the titty.

the day i invented the portal gun is the day i lost her...yeah,that's the three lines of math that 
seperate my life,as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.

--i want u have a normal life,that's sth u can't have when ricks shows up,everyth real turns out fake.
everth rights wrong.all u know is that u know noth and he knows everth...and,well,he's not a villan,
but he should't be ur hero.he's more like a demon,or a super fuck-ed god...u think my ricks dead,he's
alive,u think u r safe,he's coming for u.
--let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard.


--s306 BGM

--that stuff is alive and it belongs with us.we yank them from their homes and locked them in a can.
--that's what they do,they live in pain.they are pain.they are all the bad parts of us.which,by the 
  way,incl our dishonsety.
--so now ,becuz i'm make entirely of toxins i'm also a liar?u little sociopath.

--i had all my problems removed--my entilement,my narcissism,my crippling loneliness,my irrational 
  attachments.u poor,dumb,sick animals.

--u weren't a 14-year-old boy from the midwest,who ran away from his family an capitalized on his
  lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker?
--i guess i was pretty up front about that,wasn't i?


--ther're the writers of their own press releases.ther're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour 
  talking and 20 minutes jumping around while shit blows up.

--let me check my list of power and weakness,ability is to do anything...but only whenever i want...yeah,
  that sounds like a job for me.

  i was also late becuz of my drinking and mentioned it to zero applause.

  superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everth like it's mind blowing.

--it's really bums me out.it's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like me.
--they just call themselves heroes so they can ...
--i'm calling them that!they are my heroes,mine!
--huh,no accounting for taste.

--everyone in the universe is a hero,all u have to do is know the difference between good and bad.
--he says the good and bad are artifical constructs.
--i get the feeling...he kind of needs that to be the case.


--jesus christ,what a shitty neutrino bomb.it's a miracle i ever actually destroy anything.
--ooh,i don't know.u managed to destory just about everything today.the villains,the heroes,the lines between them,
  my childhood...
--thank yeewwwww.i appreciate it.i know u were sucking the kool-aid out of the vindicators'dick.so the fact that
  i was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.
--yeah,it is.u know why?becuz when u're an asshole,it doesn't matter how right u r.nobody wants to give u the
  satisfaction.
--i know,everyone wants people they like to be right.that's why popular people are fucking dumb and why u 
  pretentious,poorly-written high budget friends back there can eat a double-decker shit sandwich
--guys,stop! u're just proving my asshole garndpa right!

--oof! didn't see that coming 
--is that sarcasm?i don't want u slipping away when this is over.all of these deaths r on ur hands.
--okay,maybe couple of them,but definitely not this guy.

--open to second opinion.
--hey ,i don't know,i mean,look,when i get drunk,i get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it.it's,like,
  it's possible i got so drunk.i felt i was losing morty to Vindicators.and maybe this is my way of saying.'okay,
  u can have him but only if u know how important he is.otherwise i will kill u.'
--that is a...really specific guess.
--look,there's nothing in the room but us,i'm just using logic to connect some dots,it's the best guess i've got.

--but u r betting our lives on it.
--i'ii cover that bet.i get it.
--well,i think u're doing that smirky face becuz u're misinterpreting the moment.i am not being coy about some 
  hidden love for u.i want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess,like,if i gave u an amulet lase
  night,or...

--sorry,i'm not good at goodbyes,and..i'm drunk so,u know,i just...it looks like i'm never going to see u again.
  i can't really roll with the hero types and i don't...they...they don't want me around.but i want u to know.even
  if i didn't show it at the time,i really appreciated u sticking by me.god damn it.why am i crying?it make no 
  sense.ugh,u're...u're probably confused,becuz we barely knew each other,but u really stuck ur neck out when u
  gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room.everbody else had their head so far up their ass.even my
  own grandson is like,'oh,the Vindicators,they're so cool'.i mean ,he's a moron,that's their demographic.but u're
  different.Noob Noob.u're fucking cool.and u're smart.and i bet we coulda hung out and shit.and i hope u get to be
  a full-fledged Vindicator.do me a favor,don't...don't let them know that i got emotionals.but u can tell them one
  thing.tell them i said...oh fuck.okay,i just shit myself.okay,later.


--never said that.
--yeah.i feel safe already.
--no doubt,who do we make the check out to.
--i will say,we r getting some good licks in while chocking to death...right?
