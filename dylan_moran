sorry that's a spoiler,but we are,we're all going to die.we are alone,cuz people don't really have religion
any more,u know.we have the religion ,the th that makes u feel bad from the moment u're awake,with god
squatting on the end of ur bed,with his fist pressed between ur eyes going,'wake up,shit bag!'that's 
religion.

life is so brief.here we are.there r four ages of human being.child,failure,old and dead,that's it! that's
all u have.u have to be here and enjoy it.of course people want distraction,becuz reality is pretty tough
stuff.

my self-loathing is much worse than urs.what's that u c?i wish i had the strength for that.of course u get
depressed,that's why we don't want to spend time alone,cuz we're afraid of our own thoughts.have u had bath
?that goes on a bit too long,doesn't it ?by the end of that u think.'get me out of here!it's enough!i'm 
alone and i'm wet,i have to dry myself,i hate that bit!'
