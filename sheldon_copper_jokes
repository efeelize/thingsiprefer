#1 - S03 E11

Sheldon: I made tea.
Leonard: I don't want tea.
Sheldon: I didn't make you tea. This is my tea.
Leonard: Then why did you tell me?
Sheldon: It's a conversation starter.
Leonard: That's a horrible conversation starter.
Sheldon: Oh, is it? We're conversing. Checkmate.

#2 - S06 E21

Amy: Ok Sheldon, make a wish and blow off the candles.
(Sheldon attempts to blow but Amy blocks one intentionally.)
Amy: Oops, missed one. Now your wish can't come true.
Sheldon: Lucky for you, cuz I wished you were dead.

#3 - S02 E18
(A tie is hanging on Leonard's door knob.)
Sheldon: What does it mean?
Penny: Oh, come on, you went to college.
Sheldon: Yes, but I was 11.

#4 - S05 E01

Sheldon: For the record, I do have genitals and they are functional and aesthetically pleasing.

#5 - S03 E10

Sheldon: Why are you crying?
Penny: Because I'm stupid!
Sheldon: Well that's no reason to cry; one cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because
 others are stupid and it makes me sad.

#6 - S01 E11

Sheldon: Checkmate.
Leonard: Aaow! Again?
Sheldon: Obviously, you're not well-suited for three-dimensional chess. Perhaps three-dimensional 
Candy Land would be more your speed.
Leonard: Just reset the board.
Sheldon: It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.

Leonard: I did a bad thing.
Sheldon: Does it affect me?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Then suffer in silence.

Sheldon: The need to find another human being has to share one's life with has  always puzzled me.
maybe because I am so interesting all by myself. 
With  that being said, may *you* find as much happiness with each other as I  find on my own.
