--u too?this is beneath u.u r an intelligent woman.
--i guess i have a lot to learn about holiday tradition.


--don't u think it might actually be fun?
--look.u know i'd do anyth u did.but...i'm a jehovah's witness.we're not supposed to celebrate
  christmas.
--i've been thinking about that,i may have a loophole.what if u were a jehovah's witness that was
  merely pretending to be into christmas,gathering clues and blending in to take down the holidays
  from within?
--u mean like a spy investigating,makeing it seem like i'm celebrating,when actually i'm infiltrating
  santa's operation?


--hey ,handsome,this seat taken?
--struck out,huh?
--if that makes u feel better.or maybe i just realized that was spending the whole night
  getting to third base with the wrong person.u're a good friend.and i don't say that often
  enough.
--that's really nice.

--i've been defining myself with reactions to and from other people my whole life.now i
  feel worthless just becuz i'm worthless in reaction to my friends.which means they're
  not my friends.u and jeff have actually known each other longer than anybody,huh?
  i always forget that,i guess cuz u guys don't really act like friends.
--yean.i guess not so much.
--where're we going?
--well,i think u should go home.becuz u're having an existential crisis.and the best lesson
  u could take away from it,is that u r someone,even when u're by urself.
--i think u're right.and please don't  take offense at this,but thank u for not hitting on
  me.i was just vulnerable enought to do sth really stupied.what's wrong?
--nothing.the stuip steer wheel.is on the wrong side of the car.


--we gotta start taking risks again.
--well,that's convenient for the one with nothing to lose.
--oh,so the person with the least wealth,has the least wlid argument?that's convenient.


--u have feeling for her.u disguesting monster!
--fine.sth about everybody liking her turns me on.it's a problem i have.
--here we go.love isn't a game,say the guy always win.
--i stand down for an hour.


--what u guys been up to?
--we sold out.


--that's a serious allegation.i hope u can back it up.
--i'm inclined to agree with the man in uniform.
--shocker.
--hold up.i'm upholding with this guy.a man has gotta have code.


--u don't need authority to get a confession,u need leverage.someth to hold over his head.
--like what?
--break into his locker.u'll find enough dirt to bury him.
--it's not ethical.
--oh,so now u're feeling ur softness?i say do what u have to do.it's too late to get
  compassionate.we only have time to get justice.


--rings a bell.i'll check the log.
--walk it off.
--i'm not falling for that.
--i'd say our hands r tied.but we basically have no hands.

--u can dance all day.but sooner or later.the music's gonna change.
--this place is represented by two separate,yet equally important types of
  people:the goofballls that run around stirring up trouble,and the eggheads
  that make a big deal out of it.


--we can't both do the zinger.
--duy-doy!


--i guess we're even on the hurting-each-other front.
--this is just a setback.
--guess i better go break the news to him.he's not gonna like this.
--u're underestimating him.i think he is a lot more mature than we all give
  him of credit for.


--marriage is a lie,no body commits to this.nobody stays with anybody forever.
--i'm gonna stay sb forever.it's in my stupid DNA.i was born to be a wife,and
  that's all i'm never gonna be!
--u expect anyone r to believe that?
--i don't care if anybody believes it,jackass.it's a fact!
--prove it,ding dong.
--i promise to put ur dreams before mine.
--i promise to bottle up repuision at the sight of ur hair in the drain.
--i promise to earn no more than 70% of what u would make at the same job.
--what about babies.
--what about them?
--how many?
--pick a number,dick.like,it's up to me... i was a fool to think i was destined for 
  a life of this.i mean,look around...can u even imagine what knid of wedding i 
  could throw if i actually gave a crap?no offence.
--knock it off.people can make sorts of promises,but they never stick it out.

--what's with u?
--this is who i am.


--i'm really having trouble coming up with a toast.
--i find that hard believe.u once convinced others that turtlenecks were made of turtle's neck.
--it's my super powers.and i can assume any position taht suits my purpose.in that example...
  keeping turtlenecks as an option for myself,down the road.but i do have the kryptonite.it's
  so obvious to me that marriage is dumb,i can't even pretend to get behind it.


--effective immediately.
--u 24 hours has expired.

--all due respect,sir.i have zero respect for u.listen up.i could have a million years
  and could spend every minutes of it.i could live a million years and could spend every
  minutes of doing important ths.but at the end of it all,i would have on lived half a
  life.if i had not raised a son.this was a gift that was handed to u.u squardered it.
  and the reason u have so much hatred in ur heart is becuz u're trying to fill the hole
  where u kid was supposed to go.and now it's too late.now u're just stomping around trying
  to prove u exist.well,mission accomplished.but here's a question i'll like to pass on to u.
  from every son of every crap dad that ever lived,so what?i'm done with u.  


--i can't choose between...tell me what to do.
--i don't really see the dilemma.it seem more or less identical.
--they're not--they couldn't be.
--well,what do u feel like doing?
--but they're making me choose,and if i choose wrong,it could screw up my whole life.
--if u really have to make a decision,i say go with whateever makes u happiest.becuz
  again,they're virtually the same th.
--i think i know what i need to do.
--don't get cokey,kid.

--but ,i realize no one's better than anyone else,i mean ,some people are better at sports 
  and...but i was put on this earth to do sth else.
--so u're going to be what?
--u're making a hughe mistake,son.
--that may be,sir.but at least it's  my mistake.
--it doesn't change the fact that it's a mistake.
--doesn't it?


--u hate urselfe more than u should.and that ur passion inspired me.

--did u know that u possess the greatest gift life can give--the heart of hero.and it's up
  to u not to waste it like i did?i'd like to give u a chance to do what i never did,become
  u own man.

--when any of u chew gum,i want to punch u.u may as well have submachine guns in ur mouths.
  it virbrates my skull.


--u'd think by now we would have learned to be better people,i think we got into this mess by 
  thinking there was such a th as better people.
--he admitted he was falwed,and he died rich.let's celebrate his life and death in the honest
  way.not by saying fake nice ths around a casket.but by admitting we're monesters.let's 
  empty pur tanks of lies once and for all.


--can't look u right now.
--then u should know i'm crying.
--i forgive u.but only to escape the established pattern of self-righteous indignation folks followed
  by immediate comeuppance.
--okay,i guess this happening anyway.u guys r changing ur faces,r u mad at me or hungrey?
--it sounds worse on paper than it was.

--he's catfishing u.
--i did what i did the name of breakfast.
--i bore my soul to u.do u care about people at all?


--i may have wanted to slap him now and again.
--ready to deal out the truth.nothing to hide.

--it' time to level up.
--life is weird.it's a container for all this little stuff.and u get caught up in it.
  and then,the container just...
--the case get cold again.

--becuz u're like a single-called organism,no nerve.
--don't tell me what i can't do.what do u think u r?

--it's no way he did it.
--innocent people don't confess.

--let me know if u need for me.on the down low,way down low.
--hard-core fans.
--on.excuse me for being alive in the 90's.and having two ears connectef to a heart.


--when it rains,it pours.

--i never lied to u.i showed u the right truth.when we met,u were an aclectic anarchist,how
  did u become the group's airhead?u;ve gone from an independent divorce,striking out her
  own to an bankrupt fry cook hoping for a call from her husband?u entire idenity has been
  consumed by ur relationship with another man.and what happened to u,the unstoppable go-getter?
  we went in one end as real people,and out the other end as mixed-up cartoons.u all came here
  with a chance to be sth.and u all had that taken away from u. 
--the case is closed.


--r u trying to give us a emotional whiplash?
--look,if u feel there's more work to be done to urselves,it's a place u can do it.
--that was my actual dream.it's my fault i bailed on it.a degree doesn't make me a 
  filmmaker.i need to learn how to work with other people.i need to figure out who
  i am.
--a little victories counter a lot around here.even if u never asked to win in the
  first place.and u have to enjoy those nice moments while u can.becuz around here,
  they never last very long.


--looks as if u lost ur way.let's just say sb can't take a compliment.
--u just described slavery.
--i don't want to talk about it.
--get out of my brain.


--how would i go about getting records for certain alunmi?
--why do u think a stranger could just walk in here and do that?
--i know what makes u off-putting,but why r u here?


--r u looking for ur friends?they don't go here anymore?maybe u looking for someth in front
  of u the whole time,just a pitch?
--request denied.
--i'm not here.i'm just a figment of ur creeping dementia.


--relax,i come in peace.way i see it,i screwed u,i got screwed back.now we can bygone the 
  bygones,becuz i got a juicy new client and a bone to throw u.
--a human could've said that without salivating.
--look what that school did to u?it took all ur money,it took four years of ur life.and 
  worst of all.it took ur moves.
--look.i might be broke,desperate,and needless homeless.but i still got one th deep down
  inside,that gives me power.
--shock me by impressing me.
--what?i told u!how could u let this happen?
--bring me all the paperwork for filling a class action:letters of intend,engagement,everth.
  multiple copies.
--u just lost our client!
--yeah,but i can creat five new ones.
--that's everyth u asked for.who r u flipping?
--i forgot what it was like to be good at being bad.
--so just close the deal and bring it home to daddy,eh?
--sorry,change of daddies.i'll take it from here.
--u scared me.
--good.guys like u should be more scared.u're amateur monester.and u stomp in the grave
  of a real monster who was willing to stay buried.becuz real monesters have shame.


--ooh...make'em dance.
--ew..what's ur evil old legal nemesis doing here?
--nemesis?we were partner again.until i lost my usefulness.i may be evil.but ur friend
  here is so much more dangerous.anyway,i'll leave u to pick up these pieces.


--i've been spending so much time with computers,u tears r just ones and zeroes to me.
--full disclosure:our lives are worse than the day we got here.
--well.that is a serious allegation to arrive at all by urselves.r u sure?
--i'll back u up for no matter what.


--speaking of irony,how's the therapy market?depressed?
--i'm on asbbatical.i'm doing hands-on research about the psychology of alchohslism.
--u r a bartender,aren't u?
--which is basically like a moderen-day therapist.if sb tells me about a murder.i can't tell
  anyone.


--don't logic this one away from me.we finally figured out a way make paintball coll again.
--fair enough.i was reaching.

--i'm so used to being the guy who can talk his way out of anyth.but what do u say when u don't
  want a way out? what u all have done for me is indescribable.and my love for u is immeasurable.
  even when u split it seven ways.


--i know u're busy.so allowed me to whip it out.what's that?not enough money?i'll double it.bam.done,
  that's how we negotiate.lunch?
--wow,i drive a  hard bargain.but,aren't u worried i'm a little out of practice?
--please,u were a better lawyer when u weren't a lawyer than most lawyer i know.it's still in u.
--i'll it some thought.
--just shake my hands,u idiot.it's simple.
--take look around,it's ur new old life.


--what do u say when u talk to him about us?do u tell him the th is good?
--i don't know.r thry?
--what do u think?
--well.i guess i wonder why we don't remember our anniversary.it seems like u know that would be 
  special to us.like,espcially ths were good.sth we want to celebrate.
--how long have felt this way?
--not that long.it' more lately i guess.it feel diffrent.like we working it too hard.and i don't
  think it should be.it feels like we're just going to the motions.i don't want lose what we had.
--wait,r u breaking up with me?
--i think so?i don't think this is the way either of us thought this would go.
--no ,i can't say that i did.


--first,the easiest part,becuz it's the most obvious,i'm sorry.i think i proved today that i'm 
  not ready for this.i wanted it work,i did.i care about u so much.and i love being around u.
  i think i'm  better as ur friend.becuz that i know i can be good at.


--i don't understand the whole relationship th.it should be easy,but he say it isn't.becuz he's
  afraid if he doesn't,it just ends.then what,what if they don't friends anymore? he hates that.
  he'd hates himself.so he's here,at this point,not knowing how to talk to her.not knowing how
  to tell her he wants to break up.
--i'm sorry.i shouldn't brought u down here.into any of this.
--that's true.i'm stand by that.but commiting to them isn't dumb.i wish i have the courge to 
  commit to a bit like u,or to relationship.commiting is hard.becuz we're all sacred of what
  happens when we find out we committed to the wrong th.but there's no shame in what he's done.
  he put himself out there and he really tried and that proves he cares.that said,and as hard
  as it may seem,right now,he needs to show he cares.he needs to put himself out there here and
  own how he feels,that proves he's a man.
  

--perhaps i'll pencil him for a session.


--r u serious?u mean put my intergrity on the line?u mean to jeopadize the very reputation of this
  school that i spent so long protecting? and that is what i would be saying if i gave a crap.
--i knew this day will come.i'm outta here.
--there u go.my work is done.now u can direct ur anger and resentment at each other.

--all right,way to be go-getters.
--can u tell us exactly what u did in ur lives to ends up here so that we don't make the same
  mistakes?
--she is way too angry to talk to u right now.



--do u like her?
--sure,who dosen't?
--over half the people that meet her.they could be put off by her vacuous mannequin face ,or her 
  severity.
--u know.she's no barrel of monkeys,she wants everyone to be honest,but she lies to herself.she
  seen the world,but doesn't get it.she has more fights about stuff that doesn't matter than a 
  youtube comment section.she's passionate,which i find stupid,but entertaining.but...there was
  only  attraction at first.becuz she bothered to paly hard to get.

--and slater is low maintenance.
--mm...the lowest.
--but britta's irritating,impossible,unpredictable,and she didn't like u so it felt useless to like
  her.slater likes u how u r.expects nothing from u.u're safe from change and passion.

--she says Valentines Day ritualizes a connection between affenction and candy,so girls can learn the 
  ropes of prostitution.
--transaltion.no date.
--i'm gonna join u at that dance.but as a novle boyfriend,can i get a map of the minefield known as 
  women's valentine expectations?
--every day of the year,i want u to do what makes u happy.




--u devious clump of overpriced fabric and hair product.speaking as one of the meek,as soon as i inherit
  the earth,u a dead man.
--all right,dial it back a little.




--i'm not afraid,i choose not to be around rat becuz they r unpopular.same goes for lakes.
--there's only soultion.sb has to go Chang and talk to him.i vote we all look at jeff at the same time.
--in a way,all of u r right.okay.what was i tuning out?
--guys,what makes u think i can convince Chang of anything?if i can't even convince u not to make me to
  do it?
--u're the one with the silver tongue.he does raise a good point.
--u want me to risk the C that i'm pulling in that psycho's class by putting myself on his radar?i mean,
  that guy goes any more nuts,he's gonna win a Grammy.
--fine,i'll do it.but when u find my body,don't believe the suicide note.


--we make an amazing team.
--i know.we're so in sync.it's like a perfect duet or ...
--they'll need a miracle to wim in rebuttal.he is finished.
--eat that,simons.he's got robbed.


--i have this weird pain right above my eyebrow.
--it's called a stress headache.i got my first one when i was four.
--i hate it.
--well,get used to it.u're knee-deep in it now,brother.this is debate,if u want to win,u need to prepare.
--well,agreed,but if u want to win,u need to loosen up.go off book,robot debater.

--he's so good at using his inherent magnetism to sell his points.and here i am,like a spinster librarian 
  with my hair pulled back.


--lay off,simon.jeff didn't understand the rules.
--yeah,what's ur excuse,eight points?
--dude,leave her out of this.
--that's it,dude.we r gonna debate the living crap out of u.we've got some preparing to do.
--u can't unring that bell.


--bite me.
--maybe he is right.u really r all sizzle and no steak.u probably couldn't beat him if u tried.
--what do u mean i can't beat him?u and i r gonna study harder than we've ever studied before and beat them 
  tomorrow.
--really?
--no.who am i,iCarly?
--he's right,u act like ths don't bother u ,but they do.


---i was a lawyer.i was a debater for money.i think i can handle this.when i talk about...i could cite quotes or
   dig up statistics,but those r just words and numbers.i think we could have a little more fun.
--by zeus,what sort of jackassery is this?we're in the middle of championship debate.
--okay,they've got us by the short ones.

--can i ask u a personal question,senor Chang?
--okay,Freud.sure,u try to penetrate my psychologiacl armor,and...
--did u wife leave u?
--how did u know?
--well,when u pick juries,u learn to read the little stuff.
--u make no mistake about this.
--yeah,u look like u would have to.i'm not surprised u said that.

--what about tonight?
--absoutely,oh,shoot!u know,u have been really letting us have it with this homework.
--i reall have,haven't i?tell u what.for my new buddy,essay canceled,sha-clackey.
--fantastic.everbody will be so happy.
--i suppose it will put u in an unenviable and uncomfortable position,and want to be...

--he's hiding sth.
--he suffered for us.give him a little credit.
--yeah,u can be pretty cold.
--try to join the rest of us in reality.


--class dismissed.
--i can't believed i'm misled u like that.

--u sure u don't want a peice of that
--u miss the headline.

--i'm sorry i'm not good at being coy.

--u know,downgrading  ur lifestyle is ur chance to grow as a person,maybe even become one.u know,the less u have.the more
  u can be.u know what i'm saying?
--there's a silver lining here,isn't there? u're attracted to bums.
--why don't u dinner my house?

--i don't think so...how r u so satisified all the time?i mean,don't u ever want anyth more out of the cereal?...-someday u
   will known by its true names,diabets.
--u do whatever u want,u just have to know what it is.
--i could use break.

--if he's not interested,i could lose the friendship too.
--u could.love is a gamble always.but waiting won't change the dice.u either roll them or u lose u turn.
--i am going to roll them.just...i need few more shakes.

--u guys r really dorming it up in here,huh?
--excuse me,i have a future murder victim to visit.

--think i've been to this dance before.u guys r sexual partners,right?

--may i have word?
--never had him,don't want him.espcially now,he's got a real...vibe going.
--what am i supposed to to about that?

--geez,u r way out of ur element here.
--yes,and i do not believe a single word i am saying for me.but for u,maybe u're one of those rare
  people with noth underneath the surface.
--thx,coach,can u trun the TV back on?
--u can looke down and think,i was a huge phony before,i can do it again.
--u're into me.
--i beg ur unbelieveable pardon.
--look at all this work u're doing just to have me around again.u were may more attracted to me than u were 
  willing to admit.

--i don't care what u think,for mr,that was huge.

--don't tell them my business,i will slap that smug look right off ur pointy face.
--ten-to-one says it's him.
--that boy's soothsayer,that was wrinkling my brain.u tell me my future right now,u evil wizard!
--that boy's flat out prescient.he can read our minds.he's a witch.get him!
--i'm a student of human character.i know u guys all so well i can predict ur behavior.
--what do u need a paper for?u knew what was gonna happen yesterday,u middle-eastern magic eight ball.
  what's my destiney? am i gonna die in a car? is it gonnan happen soon?
--i have no psychic abilities,i'm just a entertainer.


--i also know u have thinly veiled rage issues.jeff's character acts like nothing around here affects him,
  but ths bother him more than he lets on.he's also very vain.



--goodness,look what we have stumbled onto an opportunity to help each other out...u start getting what i mean?
--no.i need another example.

--can i talk to u for a sec?
--after the dean talked about footbal.u and i were thinking the same th.

--just to get a glimpse of the world that i once ruled.and i just wanna jump out of my car,run up the steps and
  exploit the legal system for profit.but i can't.i'm locked out of my old kingdom.u r not.u c what i'm saying?
  i'd tell u to do the math.the math isn't improtant. ..this decision has to be urs.and this decision has to be
  yes.

--and for that u'd convince him to flush his life down football toilet again?u r the most selfish person alive.
  and all that is gonna end right now.becuz i'm telling him what kind of friend u really r.
--the important th's u r the only one here for him.and u don't really care what he wants.just as long as u 
  don't have to share him with the rest of the world.becuz,really,u r just as selfish as i am.u're just not as
  good as it yet.

--profound,but technically meaningless.and don't bother trying that th that women do where they walk away and
  make the guy feel like carp,becuz it wouldn't happen.


--why do we inflict so much pain on ourselves for men?
--screw him,there r guys out there they would kill to be with u.and he isn't one of them,that's him failing ur
  standards.u got that?

--a life of disillusionment and depression begins on the other side of that door.
--well,buckle up.i was exaggerating.it's kinda my gimmick.let me tell u sth...
--i couldn't take the pressure.so i took the easy way out.but when u showed me that field,i saw there was noth
  to worry about here.i could just play for the fun of it.i mean,have u ever seen those guys?there is nowhere
  to go but up...u should try accepting where u're at.man.

--okay,maybe i was a little more wrong.i should grow up and make peace withe being here.i mean,it's not like
  it's gonna kill me anyth.

--this has the potential to be a uniquely experience.


--i'm sure he will sign up for football,if and when some accident damages the part of his brain that feels pride.
--well,that sort of of my gimmick.but we didi lean on that pretty hard last week.i can lay low for an episode.
--i will save u the trouble,zero.

--i can't take it anymore.
--oh,jeffrey.let them be.
--gentlemen,my name is ...my grandfather,invented this game for one purpose...to have the loudest,dumbest th
  happen.now it has.the game of football is completed.u're free to return to ur undoubtely hearing impaired
  families.
--tell u what,we'll stop playing.if u can score a point on us.
--tempting,but then wouldn't be playing foosball? and,if so.how would i not be a loud,weird knob?
  sorry,luftballlons,i'm above it.
--i wish there was a word to describe the pleasure i fell at veiwing misfortune...a face of broken
  man.

---season's greeting from...
--i guess that means u're gonna have me ejected from winter wonderland for not loving christmas enough.
--nope ,not for that.
---the wizard didn't bring us here to finding the meaning of christmas.and i can't have anyone going
   beyond this point.that's on his side.
--with u to the end,man.always.

--snap out of it.
--whoa,whoa,who taught u therapy?Michael jackson's dad?

--this is not real!
--u r very clever,but it stops here.there's no more journey.it's just u against reality.and reality 
  always wins.

--whooaf.it's depressing there this time of year.

--no,it's a metaphor.it reperesents lack of payoff.
--correct.thinking there was sth u could do to save christmas,turning urself into an animated character
  in searching of the holiday's meaning,these were mechanisms u used to escape this...it's nothing left
  to do now but heal.and share the experience with as many reputable journals as possible.
--great,look what u did to the kid.
--this is not my fault,this is what christmas does to people.we put too much meaning into it,and it lets 
  us down.

--we beg to differ.
--what r u doing back here?
--saving christmas.everbody point ur magic christmas weapons at him.
--oh,brother.this is ridiculous.u r enabling a delusion.
--the delusion u're trying to cure is called christmas.
--it's the crazy notion that the longest,coldest,darkest nights,can be the warmest and brightest.and when
  we all agree to support each other in that insanity.someth even crazier happens,it becomes true.works
  everyear,like clockwork.

--wait,what?let's not go overboard.
--will u two commit to sth for a change?
--can we sing while we blow him away?
--absoultely.

--but for the rest of us ,it's still a good time to remember that it's good to be nice.video games for 
  two straight weeks.that's what christmas is for.hanging out with the people u love,and saying i love
  u.
--initate self-destruct.
--i get it.the meaning of christmas is...the idea that christmas has meaning.and it can mean whatever
  we want.for me,it used to mean being with my mom,now it means being with u guys.

--we're stop-motion again.
--oh,don't worry,man.i did this.
--why?
--well, i always liked the way fake food looked on those animated shows,i mean,get a load of these ths,
  they really stepped up a notch in terms of visual deliciousness.
--i know what u mean.look at that perfect bite.
--it's a little odd that i see this,too,though.don't u think?
--yeah.we're weird that way.

--why do we always wind up in this position?for all the time u spend here,u'd think we wouldn't have to
  cram so much.
--we don't have to cram last minute anymore.last minute got moved to tomorrow.
--u have got to be kidding me.

--after cake,we cram for realsies.finals are coming up.

--permission to treat the witness as hostile.
--i'll allowed.

--people been clowning me about this jacket since i got here,but if i take it off to make them happy,that 
just makes me weak,right?
--listen,it doesn't matter.your lose the jacket to please them,you keep it to piss them off.either way

the funny thing about being smart is that u can get through most of life without ever having to do any 
work,so ,uh...i am not really sure how to do that.

--Abed,the floor can't be lava forever,the game's got to end.
--it's not a game for me,Troy.i'm seeing real lava becuz u're leaving.it's embarrssing,and i don't want to
 be crazy.but i am crazy,so...i made a game that made u and everyone else see what i see.i dont't want it
 to be there either,i swear,i want u to be able to leave,but i don't think the lava goes away  until u
 stop leaving.
--so the only way i can help u is by giving up my chance to be one person?

--just give me ur hands.
--i dont't think the lava's here becuz u're leaving,i think it's here becuz i won't let go.

--u don't get it,no one gets abed,i got him a little.

what u see may be what u don't want,but it's also what u get.this human question mark...with a Ph.D in being
swell,and a master in 'everbody loves me?'who is it?we may never know.i only know one th,nobody is this
good a person.and nobody can get any worse than this,

--u ever have sth that u didn't truly appreciate until u didn't have it anymore?
the old me would have been long gone by now.i didn't think i could ever change,but i'm gonna tell u,the love
of a good woman makes anyth possible.

--don't say anyth until i've said what i've got to say...and i've never taken u as seriously as i should have
.u r the strangest,coolest,most genuine person i've ever met,and the th that scares me about u is how good u
make me wish i was,help me,help me become like u.i mean,i am so amazing,but i'm not perfect.u are.give me
that power,so i can abuse it.
--u can't fake being good in order to get away with doing bad ths.
--i completely understand, and do u understand that i still have to try?

we are not defined by our limitations,we are defined by our potentials,

--why do u wanna know the secrect to making a woman psycho?
--why do we wanna know how to blow up the earth or grow a human ear on a mouse?in case we have to.

she likes guys who are mean to her,she dosen't like herself.
none of us have to 'go to 'anyone,and the idea we do is a mental illness,we contracted from breath mint
commercials...we can't keep going to each other until we learn to go to ourselves,stop making our hatred of
ourselves ,someone else's job.and just stop hating ourselves.

--i'm warning u as a friend to get off of those meds and until they're out of ur systems,stay away from 
  flattering situations...weddings,soft lighting,formal wear,gay bars.and take those off.
--becuz they make me look good?
--that'd not relevant.

--i'm sorry ,but this is where we have to put our foot down.i say we let this play out.we could actually hurt him
  if every time he face reality.we dress up and play make-believe to ball him out.
--shame on u people.it's not our job to help him grow up.he dosen't need reality.he is a magical,elf-like man,
  who makes us all more magical by being near us.all we have was dumb reality before we met that man,and he's 
  made all of our lives better than reality.now it becomes little inconvenient,and it's time to get real?for 
  shame!

--becuz u don't like people who tell u what to do and i don't want to be one of those people.
--then don't be.
--i have to be.sometimes u're just gonna have to trust that i know better about stuff.
--i don't know if i can do this.
--then i guess u're gonna have to trust me.
--well ,i don't want to stop being ur friend,so...i guess i'll let u tell me what do to sometimes.
