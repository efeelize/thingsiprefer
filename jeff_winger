--people been clowning me about this jacket since i got here,but if i take it off to make them happy,that 
just makes me weak,right?
--listen,it doesn't matter.your lose the jacket to please them,you keep it to piss them off.either way
 it's for them.that's what's weak.

the next person who offer me charity or pity will be mentioned by name in my suicide note.

--mylady
--mylord

the funny thing about being smart is that u can get through most of life without ever having to do any 
work,so ,uh...i am not really sure how to do that.

--Abed,the floor can't be lava forever,the game's got to end.
--it's not a game for me,Troy.i'm seeing real lava becuz u're leaving.it's embarrssing,and i don't want to
 be crazy.but i am crazy,so...i made a game that made u and everyone else see what i see.i dont't want it
 to be there either,i swear,i want u to be able to leave,but i don't think the lava goes away  until u
 stop leaving.
--so the only way i can help u is by giving up my chance to be one person?

--just give me ur hands.
--i dont't think the lava's here becuz u're leaving,i think it's here becuz i won't let go.

--u don't get it,no one gets abed,i got him a little.

what u see may be what u don't want,but it's also what u get.this human question mark...with a Ph.D in being
swell,and a master in 'everbody loves me?'who is it?we may never know.i only know one th,nobody is this
good a person.and nobody can get any worse than this,

--u ever have sth that u didn't truly appreciate until u didn't have it anymore?
the old me would have been long gone by now.i didn't think i could ever change,but i'm gonna tell u,the love
of a good woman makes anyth possible.

--don't say anyth until i've said what i've got to say...and i've never taken u as seriously as i should have
.u r the strangest,coolest,most genuine person i've ever met,and the th that scares me about u is how good u
make me wish i was,help me,help me become like u.i mean,i am so amazing,but i'm not perfect.u are.give me
that power,so i can abuse it.
--u can't fake being good in order to get away with doing bad ths.
--i completely understand, and do u understand that i still have to try?

we are not defined by our limitations,we are defined by our potentials,

--why do u wanna know the secrect to making a woman psycho?
--why do we wanna know how to blow up the earth or grow a human ear on a mouse?in case we have to.

she likes guys who are mean to her,she dosen't like herself.
none of us have to 'go to 'anyone,and the idea we do is a mental illness,we contracted from breath mint
commercials...we can't keep going to each other until we learn to go to ourselves,stop making our hatred of
ourselves ,someone else's job.and just stop hating ourselves.
