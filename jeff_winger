--i can't take it anymore.
--oh,jeffrey.let them be.
--gentlemen,my name is ...my grandfather,invented this game for one purpose...to have the loudest,dumbest th
  happen.now it has.the game of football is completed.u're free to return to ur undoubtely hearing impaired
  families.
--tell u what,we'll stop playing.if u can score a point on us.
--tempting,but then wouldn't be playing foosball? and,if so.how would i not be a loud,weird knob?
  sorry,luftballlons,i'm above it.
--i wish there was a word to describe the pleasure i fell at veiwing misfortune...a face of broken
  man.

---season's greeting from...
--i guess that means u're gonna have me ejected from winter wonderland for not loving christmas enough.
--nope ,not for that.
---the wizard didn't bring us here to finding the meaning of christmas.and i can't have anyone going
   beyond this point.that's on his side.
--with u to the end,man.always.

--snap out of it.
--whoa,whoa,who taught u therapy?Michael jackson's dad?

--this is not real!
--u r very clever,but it stops here.there's no more journey.it's just u against reality.and reality 
  always wins.

--whooaf.it's depressing there this time of year.

--no,it's a metaphor.it reperesents lack of payoff.
--correct.thinking there was sth u could do to save christmas,turning urself into an animated character
  in searching of the holiday's meaning,these were mechanisms u used to escape this...it's nothing left
  to do now but heal.and share the experience with as many reputable journals as possible.
--great,look what u did to the kid.
--this is not my fault,this is what christmas does to people.we put too much meaning into it,and it lets 
  us down.

--we beg to differ.
--what r u doing back here?
--saving christmas.everbody point ur magic christmas weapons at him.
--oh,brother.this is ridiculous.u r enabling a delusion.
--the delusion u're trying to cure is called christmas.
--it's the crazy notion that the longest,coldest,darkest nights,can be the warmest and brightest.and when
  we all agree to support each other in that insanity.someth even crazier happens,it becomes true.works
  everyear,like clockwork.

--wait,what?let's not go overboard.
--will u two commit to sth for a change?
--can we sing while we blow him away?
--absoultely.

--but for the rest of us ,it's still a good time to remember that it's good to be nice.video games for 
  two straight weeks.that's what christmas is for.hanging out with the people u love,and saying i love
  u.
--initate self-destruct.
--i get it.the meaning of christmas is...the idea that christmas has meaning.and it can mean whatever
  we want.for me,it used to mean being with my mom,now it means being with u guys.

--we're stop-motion again.
--oh,don't worry,man.i did this.
--why?
--well, i always liked the way fake food looked on those animated shows,i mean,get a load of these ths,
  they really stepped up a notch in terms of visual deliciousness.
--i know what u mean.look at that perfect bite.
--it's a little odd that i see this,too,though.don't u think?
--yeah.we're weird that way.

--why do we always wind up in this position?for all the time u spend here,u'd think we wouldn't have to
  cram so much.
--we don't have to cram last minute anymore.last minute got moved to tomorrow.
--u have got to be kidding me.

--after cake,we cram for realsies.finals are coming up.

--permission to treat the witness as hostile.
--i'll allowed.

--people been clowning me about this jacket since i got here,but if i take it off to make them happy,that 
just makes me weak,right?
--listen,it doesn't matter.your lose the jacket to please them,you keep it to piss them off.either way
 it's for them.that's what's weak.

the next person who offer me charity or pity will be mentioned by name in my suicide note.

--mylady
--mylord

the funny thing about being smart is that u can get through most of life without ever having to do any 
work,so ,uh...i am not really sure how to do that.

--Abed,the floor can't be lava forever,the game's got to end.
--it's not a game for me,Troy.i'm seeing real lava becuz u're leaving.it's embarrssing,and i don't want to
 be crazy.but i am crazy,so...i made a game that made u and everyone else see what i see.i dont't want it
 to be there either,i swear,i want u to be able to leave,but i don't think the lava goes away  until u
 stop leaving.
--so the only way i can help u is by giving up my chance to be one person?

--just give me ur hands.
--i dont't think the lava's here becuz u're leaving,i think it's here becuz i won't let go.

--u don't get it,no one gets abed,i got him a little.

what u see may be what u don't want,but it's also what u get.this human question mark...with a Ph.D in being
swell,and a master in 'everbody loves me?'who is it?we may never know.i only know one th,nobody is this
good a person.and nobody can get any worse than this,

--u ever have sth that u didn't truly appreciate until u didn't have it anymore?
the old me would have been long gone by now.i didn't think i could ever change,but i'm gonna tell u,the love
of a good woman makes anyth possible.

--don't say anyth until i've said what i've got to say...and i've never taken u as seriously as i should have
.u r the strangest,coolest,most genuine person i've ever met,and the th that scares me about u is how good u
make me wish i was,help me,help me become like u.i mean,i am so amazing,but i'm not perfect.u are.give me
that power,so i can abuse it.
--u can't fake being good in order to get away with doing bad ths.
--i completely understand, and do u understand that i still have to try?

we are not defined by our limitations,we are defined by our potentials,

--why do u wanna know the secrect to making a woman psycho?
--why do we wanna know how to blow up the earth or grow a human ear on a mouse?in case we have to.

she likes guys who are mean to her,she dosen't like herself.
none of us have to 'go to 'anyone,and the idea we do is a mental illness,we contracted from breath mint
commercials...we can't keep going to each other until we learn to go to ourselves,stop making our hatred of
ourselves ,someone else's job.and just stop hating ourselves.

--i'm warning u as a friend to get off of those meds and until they're out of ur systems,stay away from 
  flattering situations...weddings,soft lighting,formal wear,gay bars.and take those off.
--becuz they make me look good?
--that'd not relevant.

--i'm sorry ,but this is where we have to put our foot down.i say we let this play out.we could actually hurt him
  if every time he face reality.we dress up and play make-believe to ball him out.
--shame on u people.it's not our job to help him grow up.he dosen't need reality.he is a magical,elf-like man,
  who makes us all more magical by being near us.all we have was dumb reality before we met that man,and he's 
  made all of our lives better than reality.now it becomes little inconvenient,and it's time to get real?for 
  shame!

--becuz u don't like people who tell u what to do and i don't want to be one of those people.
--then don't be.
--i have to be.sometimes u're just gonna have to trust that i know better about stuff.
--i don't know if i can do this.
--then i guess u're gonna have to trust me.
--well ,i don't want to stop being ur friend,so...i guess i'll let u tell me what do to sometimes.
