--people been clowning me about this jacket since i got here,but if i take it off to make them happy,that just makes me weak,right?
--listen,it doesn't matter.your lose the jacket to please them,you keep it to piss them off.either way it's for them.that's what's weak.

the next person who offer me charity or pity will be mentioned by name in my suicide note.

--mylady
--mylord

the funny thing about being smart is that u can get through most of life without ever having to do any work,so ,uh...i am not really sure how to do that.

--abed,the floor can't be lava forever,the game's got to end.
--it's not a game for me,troy.i'm seeing real lava becuz u're leaving.it's embarrssing,and i don't want to be crazy.but i am crazy,so...i made a game that
  made u and everyone else see what i see.i dont't want it to be there either,i swear,i want u to be able to leave,but i don't think the lava goes away 
  until u stop leaving.
--so the only way i can help u is by giving up my chance to be one person?

--just give me ur hands.
--i dont't think the lava's here becuz u're leaving,i think it's here becuz i won't let go.

--u don't get it,no one gets abed,i got him a little.
